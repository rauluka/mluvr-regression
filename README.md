# Machine Learning Flavoured Linear Regression

It's a simple Octave implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm for Linear Regression.
Data Set consists of points representing superheroes.
Every point has two coordinates:
-x - superheroe costume price  
-y - number of comic book issues in which superhero appeared

To build linear regression model for this data set run in your Octave environment:
```
main
```

To plot result run:
```
plotResult
```
